# Tinder analysis

On April 2nd 2020 (day after April Fool's Day lol), Tinder announced that it will open up the use of it's Passport feature to all Tinder users. The Passport feature allows you to match with people all over the world versus your immediate area in an attempt to combat lonliness and boredom during the shelter in place and quarantine directives being rolled out all over.

The purpose of this project is two-fold:
1. Can we harness the power of online dating to land me a job?
2. Can I find a statistically significant insight on Tinder users based on a activity

## Chapter 1 - Set Up
I decided to use this opportunity to gather Tinder profile to build a database to apply my newfound data science and analytical skills towards in an attempt to combat my own lonliness and boredom during the shelter in place and quarantine directives being rolled out all over.
